# mathemactics_for_machine_learning

This repository are my submissions for the Imperial College London 3 course specialization, **‘Mathematics for Machine Learning’** available on Coursera.

The course is/was available at: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning

Not every week required a submission, so some folders are blank.
